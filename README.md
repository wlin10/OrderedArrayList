# OrderedArrayList

My group discussed:

Override add(element), add(index, element), set(index, value): throw IllegalArgumentException when null is added

Instructions omitted "element" for add methods

Reminded ourselves of the method signatures

Don't use any built in sort methods except for testing purposes: Used Comparable

Constructors are similar to the SuperArray lab we did before
